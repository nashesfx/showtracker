        <h3>We're Just Like You</h3>
        <p>ShowTracker was born from a simple idea: we love television, but we hate the chaos of managing it. We are passionate TV fans and developers who believe you should spend less time searching and more time watching.</p>
        <p>Our mission is to build the cleanest, fastest, and most user-friendly tool to organize your viewing life. We're not trying to sell you another subscription, we're here to help you manage the ones you already have.</p>
